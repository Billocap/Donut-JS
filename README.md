If don't know there's a really neat piece of code called [donut.c](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html), where the code draws a 3D donut made out of ascii characters in the terminal and it's written in the shape of a donut.
After reading the article where the creator Andy Sloane ([a1k0n](https://github.com/a1k0n)) explains how it was made, I decided to try and do my own version using JavaScript and the HTML canvas.
### Developement
For now it still a work in progress and when it's done I gonna post it on my [CodePen profile](https://codepen.io/Pikachurin).
### Contributions
Feel free to clone the repository or send me some tips, especially for reducing the size of the code and turning it into donut.
